		"headline": "The script of the era has been shattered, the uniform melody has fallen apart<br />In this chaotic age, can we find balance once again?",
		"paragraph1": "In 2026, as IT professionals and students, we stand at the forefront of a transformative era. The rise of AI challenges traditional development models, and the technical barriers that once defined our value are gradually crumbling. When the power to create becomes democratized and individual technical skills can no longer serve as our moat, \"collaboration\" becomes our most important lesson. We are heading into a grand chaos seeking harmony with AI, peers, and cross-domain partners. But what if \"chaos\" is not an obstacle, but the starting point of a new balance?",
		"paragraph2": "In the JamSession of improvisational music, there is no conductor. When the Jam's beat doesn't sync, let's create a new beat together. When the Jam's harmony isn't perfect, this is precisely the sound of our generation—inclusive, bold, and diverse. At SITCON 2026, we invite you to join this Jam. Let us harness the chaos, find rhythm in disorder, and seek resonance in collaboration.",
		"paragraph3": "Students' Information Technology Conference (SITCON), initiated in 2012, is student-centered and student-organized. We are committed to student IT education and promoting the open-source spirit, hoping to guide more students into the realm of information technology. We also hope that all students interested in IT can gather at the conference to inspire, pass on knowledge, and learn from each other, achieving the practical demonstration of \"learning by doing\" and \"teaching and learning together.\""

		"headline": "The script of our era has been shattered, and the once-unified melody now falls apart.<br />In this age of chaos, can we rediscover balance together?",
		"paragraph1": "Standing in 2026, as students and practitioners of information technology, we find ourselves at the forefront of a transformative era. The rise of AI challenges traditional development paradigms, and the technical barriers that once defined our value are gradually eroding. As the power of creation becomes democratized and individual technical prowess can no longer serve as a moat, \"collaboration\" emerges as our most critical challenge. We are heading into a grand chaos that seeks balance between AI, peers, and cross-disciplinary partners. But what if disorder is not an obstacle, but the starting point of a new equilibrium?",
		"paragraph2": "In an improvised music jam session, there is no conductor. When the beats don’t align, we create a new rhythm together. When the harmony is imperfect, that imperfection becomes the voice of our generation—inclusive, bold, unrestrained, and diverse. At SITCON 2026, we invite you to join this jam. Let us navigate chaos, find rhythm amid disorder, and seek resonance through collaboration.",
		"paragraph3": "The Students’ Information Technology Conference (SITCON), founded in 2012, is a student-centered, student-initiated conference. It has long been dedicated to advancing student IT education and promoting open-source culture. SITCON aims to guide more students into the world of information technology, while also bringing together all students interested in IT to exchange ideas, pass on knowledge, and inspire one another—realizing the spirit of learning by doing and teaching through sharing."
